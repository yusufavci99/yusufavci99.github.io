      <description>APK File
A bullet hell style casual mobile game created in Unity. The game is 3D and the projectiles come both horizontally and vertically. Yellow points show the points where the player can go. Each dodged projectile increases your score. The game was done in 3 hours. I am planning to update the game and put it on the Play Store.

      <description>Code Review Serious Game Author Module was my summer 2020 internship project. I created a serious game used in teaching the code review process. Players should fix the reviewed codes. Players&#39; submissions are evaluated and scored.
Used JS, Ace Editor Library, Judge0 API, Ajax, Firebase.
There are 3 levels to select. The serious game looks like this. Resizing is possible. Here you can see the reviews, see hints. Players can see the solutions if they want to give up.</description>

Created a basic roll-a-ball game with Unity. It uses gyroscope sensors of the phone to controll the ball. There are spikes and a hole that can kill you.
Falling in a hole can kill you. When the player dies, they see a death message. When the player wins, they see a congratulations message. </description>

      <description>Source Code
Sonat Uzun and I created an interative, procedurally generated ray tracer with WebGL. It can display triangles, spheres and cubes.
It has numerous options. Randomized trace order randomizes pixel rendering order. This results in blurry images instead of slow scans. Use texture creates the spheres with a checkers pattern texture. Moving spheres makes the spheres move in a random direction. Add options create a random sized/colored shape in a random location on screen.</description>

      <description>I ranked my favorite animes from worst to best.
Cowboy Bebop
It has a perfect setting and atmosphere. I very much like the world they created in Cowboy Bebop. It&amp;rsquo;s weakness is it&amp;rsquo;s low continuity in my opinion. When you finish an episode, Cowboy Bebop never gives you a reason to watch the next episode. There are no cliffhangers. Yet, I strongly recommend Cowboy Bebop because it has good characters, cool storylines and an amazing setting.</description>
