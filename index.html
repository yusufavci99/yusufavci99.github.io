		Welcome to testpage. This is the <strong>best</strong> page to see investment tips
		and all.
		</p>
		<p>First of all you should buy stocks when their value are very low.
		Because it actually only makes sense that way. What i mean is the thing you should do
		is buying stocks when they have a low value and selling them when they have a 
		high value. Of course this has a lot of risks and these risks should be calculated
		beforehand. Because if you think a stock value is low whereas it is actually high,
		it's value will probably drop and you will lose a lot of money. So, should you be
		a prophet or something to guess what will happen next? Not at all! You just
		need strategic thinking ability. You shoul observe the values for a long time
		before deciding to buy or sell. For summary thins you need are;
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Strong strategical thinking ability.</li>
			<li>Business knowledge.</li>
		</ul>
