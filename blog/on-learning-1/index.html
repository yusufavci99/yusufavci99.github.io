						<h1>On Learning</h1>
						<span class="post-date"># Nov 18, 2021</span>
					</div>

					<p>I love learning things. I could spend my whole life reading and researching stuff and I probably wouldn’t get bored. But that’s not how things get done. You sometimes have to take action and do something with the things you know. That is, there is a trade-off between learning more to make things better and having the actual time to do things. <strong>Mongtaigne</strong> states in his <strong>Essays</strong> that the youth (until around 20) is the time to learn and the rest of your life is time to do. I, as a learning enthuisast find this depressing. However, it seems like there is at least some truth in this. Also, most great people did their greatest achievements in their 20s or 30s.</p>
<p>I obviously don’t agree that you should stop learning but I think we should be selective in what we spend our time learning because time is precious. For instance, should you learn every single detail of a tool or read every single chapter of a book. Or should you learn the bare minimum to solve your appaerent needs. I think neither approach is very good. So how much learning is enough is my opinion?</p>
<p>There is one rule that I came up with: <strong>Don’t make mindless choices.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t make mindless choices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we should understand the system and the basic underlying concepts properly. We shouldn’t copy and paste a solution without understanding the parameters, implications, side effects, etc. (Unless it is a well known black-boxed solution). Doing something like somebody else does without considering other options is a mindless choice.</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use algorithms without understanding why they work.</li>
<li>Don’t use a system that just works and you’re afraid to touch.</li>
<li>You don’t have to know the parts that you won’t use.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend this because otherwise you wouldn’t be able to modify the solution or come up with a better solution yourself.</p>
